## ML Assignments
*  [Assignment 1: Classification](https://github.com/compagnb/MachineLearning/blob/master/Assignment1/Assignment1.md)
   *   Dataset: Amazon Fine Food Reviews
      *   The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of 455,000 food reviews Amazon users left up to October 2012.
      *   Data source reference: J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. From amateurs to connoisseurs: modeling the evolution of user expertise through online reviews. WWW, 2013.
   *   Task: Train a model to best predict helpful, a boolean indicator that a review was deemed helpful by other shoppers. This was defined as: (data.HelpfulnessDenominator > 3) & (data.helpScore >= 0.9)
   *   Model Improvements
      *   ![progress chart](https://github.com/compagnb/MachineLearning/blob/master/Assignment1/assignment1Progress.png)
